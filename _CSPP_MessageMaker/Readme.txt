To install the CSPP_Messagemaker open the
Install.vi in the the Installer subfolder.
For this you don´t have to open the project.

But: Note that you should have admin rights
to install the MessageMaker!

For the developer version:
The VIs must not be read-only. In this case
you would get a number of error messages.
