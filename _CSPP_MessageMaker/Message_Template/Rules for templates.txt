Some scripting code could not be implemented to be as flexible as wanted. For this reason several programming
guides have to be followed to get them working:

Do.vi
-----
- There should be only one LabVIEW class conatnt on the block diagram
- There should be only one case structure with the label "options" on the block diagram. Within this case structure
should be the SubVI
- There has to be one LabVIEW class control with the name "DNL_Message Template". This one will be exchanged with the
new message class.

Send Template.vi
----------------
- Please don´t use another template VI with the name Send XXX.vi.
- There can be one LabVIEW class control with the name "DNL_Message Template". This one will be exchanged with the
new message class.

In addition:
------------
Be carefull when including VIs from libraries of the target project. This can very easy lead to locked libraries because
in the end they are opened in both projects. Better: Include Dummy.vis and overwrite them with the correct ones once
you build them.
